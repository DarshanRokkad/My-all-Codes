    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannen_Says">Shannen</a> Says is an eight-episode American reality television series broadcast on WE TV in 2012. The show focuses on the preparations for the wedding of actress Shannen Doherty (pictured) and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding planner David Tutera. Filmed in Malibu, California, in 2011, Shannen Says was developed by Doherty and Iswarienko as a way to document the stress a couple experiences while planning their wedding. It was produced by RelativityReal and Doherty's production company No Apologies Productions. To prepare for filming, Doherty watched reality shows by Tori Spelling and Kim Kardashian. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video, but it was not made available on DVD or Blu-ray. The show had low viewership and ranked below most other programs when it premiered, but it had some popularity among women between the ages of 25 and 54. Shannen Says and Doherty received mixed reviews</p>
